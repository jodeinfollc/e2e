/**
 * The `e2e/agent` entrypoint: what a project builds agents from on the AI
 * SDK. The built-in agent needs no builder: an agents entry is one plain
 * object (`agents: { default: { model, system, tools } }`), and `defineTool`
 * makes its project tools. `createToolLoopExecutor` is the built-in agent's
 * loop with a caller's own prompt and tool vocabulary, for a custom brain
 * under `{ executor }`. The socket vocabulary itself, `StepExecutor` and its
 * verdicts, lives on the main `e2e` entrypoint, so a hand-rolled executor
 * needs no import from here (and no AI SDK) at all.
